        <p style="text-align:center;">You want thicker hair. I get it… Thin hair just makes you feel like your hair’s unhealthy. <br/> So, we’ll start this off by going through why your hair is thin </p>
            </p> </br>
            <hr>
        </br>
        <h2>Why is My Hair <span>So Thin?!</span></h2> </br>
        <h4>Like with many other things in life, there are multiple possible causes</h4></br>
        <h3 class='highlight'>Lets take a look at <span> 6 possible</span> causes</h3></br>
        <h4>1. STRESS!</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/stress.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Simran Sood on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            I can’t tell you how many times I’ve looked for advice on how to deal with thin hair and gotten this; “stop stressing”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is it just me, or is that the most useless piece of advice?
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I won’t tell you to stop stressing, but I will try and help you manage it
        </p></br>
        <h4>2. Harsh Products</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/heat.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Shari Sirotnak on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            If you’re using an intense shampoo and/or using it regularly, this will strip your hair of its natural oils.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again - Baby. Shampoo.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s gentle on your scalp, does the job and it’s inexpensive. You don’t need to use it all the time, maybe use it for every second wash day.
        </p></br>
        <h4>3. Neglect</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/neglect.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Anne Seubert on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            You know how people say that a child’s behaviour is a reflection of their parents? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, your hair’s appearance is generally a reflection of the love you give it.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that being said – avoid over-styling your hair because constant pulling and over-brushing is not good for her.
        </p></br>
        <h4>4. Lifestyle</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/lifestyle.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by NMG Network on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            Do you exercise? How much water do you drink every day? Are you getting enough protein? 
        </p>
        <p>
            I know this can be frustrating to hear if 1) your answer is yes, and your hair is still thin or 2) you’ve tried it before, and it didn’t work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This might be due to:
                <ul>
                    <li>genetics</li>
                    <li>health complications</li>
                    <li>inconsistency</li>
                </ul><br/>
        </p>
<h4>5. Pregnancy</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/preggo.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Mustafa Omar on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>Don't freak out! Thin hair is not a sign of pregnancy.</p>
        <p>
            Pregnancy-related hair loss commonly occurs after your baby’s birth instead of during pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The good news is this happens because of hormonal changes, so it generally resolves on its own.
        </p><br/>
        <h4>6. Age</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/age.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Brett Jordan on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        
        <p>
            “But I can’t fix that, Jay!” Yes, true. You can’t make yourself stop ageing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But there are things you can do to slow down the lovely curve balls age throws at you.

                    <li>Get social! </br>
                        Go enjoy the company of your friends and family. You need it and so do they.</br> Being around people you love can sometimes be exactly what you need to make you feel awesome.</li></br>
                    <li>Be nice to yourself. </br>
                        Don’t talk bad to  yourself. Don't talk bad about yourself. </br> Dedicate some of your time each week to selfcare. </br>

            <h4>The Right Products</h4></br>
            <img src="/media/shampoo.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Charisse Kenion on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <ul>
                    </br><li>Products with olive oil, castor oil and/or eggs are super good for your locs</li>
                    <li>Jamaican Black Castor oil is amazing. Many people shy away from it because of its thick consistency, but never fear – </br> essential oils are here! If you don’t like the thickness, you can thin it out a little with essential oils.</br> Keep in mind, a little bit goes a long way.
                    <li>Lavender and Rosemary oil are your besties. Just a drop or two will dilute thick oils nicely.</li></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </br><li>
                <h4>Show Some Love</h4></br>
                <img src="/media/show-love.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Jon Tyson on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <ul>
                    </br><li>Pay attention to the ends of your hair. The ends are the driest and the oldest so they need the most love. </br> When you apply oil, pay more, if not, all your attention to your ends. </li>
                    <li>Don’t be shy with conditioner. The lengths and ends of your hair need all the conditioner you can give them. </br> Your roots are lucky enough to benefit from natural oils right at the source, so you don't really need to condition your roots. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </br><li>
                <h4>Try Something New</h4></br>
                <img src="/media/try.jpg" width="600px"; height="400px" alt="Photo by Brett Jordan on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <ul>
                    </br><li>If your hair is thin because of genetics, there isn’t really anything you can do to thicken it. </br> You can, however, make the illusion that your hair is thick. How? Extensions! </br> Experiment with hair pieces so you can make your hair look as thick as you’d like</li>
                    <li>Eat, eat, eat</br> There are a lot of foods that can help with thinning hair. Allow me to list a few:
                        <ul>
                            </br><li>Strawberries, citrus fruits and guavas – these are great sources of vitamin C. </br> Having low levels of vitamin C has been linked to poor health outcomes.</li>
                            <li>White beans – these hold a great deal of iron. </br> Many doctors actually test their patients for iron deficiencies when they complain about thinning hair</li>
                            <li>Brown rice, broccoli and avocados – lovely vitamin B. </br> This helps strengthen your hair, and strong hair has a lower risk of breaking (duh).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The list really does go on. So, if you’d like a more detailed post on this, let me know and I will gladly put one together.

                <ul>
                    </br><li>For my older ladies, gents and everything in between - antioxidants may help you and your hair handle hormonal changes. </br> Antioxidants help shield your body from the sun and seal moisture into your hair, which retains the natural oils in your scalp.</li>
                    <li>If you have grey hair, be consistent with your deep conditioning. Unfortunately, grey hair is more susceptible to breakage.</li>
                    <li>Speak to your doctor. You could possibly be using medication that’s making your hair break.</li>
