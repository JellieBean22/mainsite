        <p style="text-align:center;">Having dry hair is never fun & it just ain’t cute. Luckily, it can be managed. </br>
            Here are some tips and tricks to help you ditch dry hair without spending heaps of cash.
            </p> </br>

        <h2>Why is My Hair <span>So Dry?!</span></h2> </br>
        <h3 class="highlight">Let's look at <span>6 possible</span> causes</h3></br>
        <div class="blog-head">
        <h4> 1. Too Much Heat</h4></br>
        </div>
          <img src=/media/heat.jpg width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Shari Sirotnak on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            Super obvious but overlooked quite often. </p>
        <p>
            Imagine sitting out in the harsh sun a couple times a month without any sunscreen or after-sun care (like aloe vera).</br> You would have really dry & sensitive skin.
        </p>
        <p>
            The same goes for your hair. </br> If you’re blow drying and flat ironing your hair regularly, even with heat protectant, your hair will start to suffer. 
        </p></br>
        <h4 class="blog-head"> 2. Chemicals </h4></br>
        </br><img src="/media/chemicals.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Artem Maltsev on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            The mere thought of using chemicals on your precious locs is terrifying and that’s because when we think “chemicals”, </br> we think of super harsh, stinky, toxic products. But many modern chemical hair products are a little deceiving. 
        </p></br>
        <h4>3. Chlorine</h4>
        <img src="/media/chlorine.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            That's right! Those late night dips do more than just cool you down.
        </p>
        <p>
            But don’t get me wrong, swimming is awesome. The only reason it will dry out your hair is if you don’t wash the chlorine </br> out after a dip in the pool.
        </p></br>
        <h4>4. Shampoo</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/shampoo.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Charisse Kenion on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            I know, I know… I just told you to wash your hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            But washing your hair is great! What isn’t great is washing your hair too often. How often is too often? Well, it depends. </br> 
            For me, three times a week is too excessive. But some people wash their hair every second day with no problem. </br> Here is where you need to listen to your hair. Only wash it when you need to, and use gentle poos.
        </p>
        <p>  
            If I need to wash my hair more than once in a week, then I use baby shampoo; it does the job without stripping my hair of </br> all its natural oily goodness. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Give it a try!
        </p></br>
        <h4>5. The Weather</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/weather.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Danny Lines on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            "But Jay, I can’t avoid the weather!” – is that what you’re thinking? I bet it is. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't worry, you don’t need to avoid crazy hot and windy weather, just protect your hair from it. </br>
            For example, I carry a scarf with me that I can use as a headwrap if the wind decides to be disrespectful. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For those of you with longer hair, you can throw your hair into a bun to at least protect the tips of your hair.
        </p></br>
        <h4>6. Using the Wrong Products</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/products.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Tyler Nix on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            One of the best pieces of hair advice I’ve been offered is: Use a shampoo for the hair you have and conditioner for the hair you want. </br> I feel like that tip is good enough on its own, but if you’d like an elaboration, feel free to <a href="mailto:hairclub@onemoreblogger.co.za"><u style="color: #0de9c4;"> let me know! </u></a>
        </p> </br>

        <h4>Now that the possible causes are out of the way, let's jump into how to fix the problem </h4> </br>
    </br>
        <h2>What Can <span>I Do </span></h2>
        <ul>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Take a Break from Heat</h4></br>
                <img src="/media/break.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Alessio Zaccaria on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <br>Plain and simple. Like I said before; listen to your hair. If she says heat ain’t it, then that’s that. </br> 
                If you use heat on your hair 4 times a month, try cut back to twice and see how that small change makes a big difference. </br> I know a lot of naturals who only use heat once a year, and their hair is thriving. </br>
                I understand that using heat once a year sounds like too much of a change for many of you, so just try cutting back </br> gradually and your hair will certainly thank you.
            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Embrace Your Natural Hair Colour</h4> </br>
                <img src="/media/natural.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Jennifer Marquez on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                </br> Dye is really tempting, and I have often fallen victim to its seduction, but there is one thing I notice a month or 2 after </br> dyeing my mane: I miss my natural colour! </br>
                There is one thing you can do if you simply can’t stay away from dyes; buy some wigs. A good wig is not cheap, but </br> it’s definitely worth it.
                The same goes for other chemical treatments like relaxers, straighteners, Brazilians, etc. </br> Just ask yourself if your hair truly needs to go through all that damage.
            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>If You are a Regular Swimmer...</h4></br> 
                <img src="/media/swim.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Collins Lesulie on Unsplash" class="body_img"></br>
                ...it’s a bad idea to wash your hair every time you swim.</br> 
                This is not to say you should just leave that nasty chlorine in your hair, instead you should buy baby shampoo or a gentle </br> 
                cleansing shampoo to get the chlorine out without drying your hair. </br>
            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Use Shampoo Sparingly</h4> </br>
                <img src="/media/wash.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Curology on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <br>A lot of people believe that the more hair you have, the more shampoo you need. </br> This is undeniable nonsense! </br> You only need enough shampoo to wash your scalp (so if your head is huge then you can disregard my above statement) </br> because this is where all your build-up is. </br>
                When you rinse out your shampoo, enough of it will touch on your length and tips without drying it out.
            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Wrap it Up</h4></br>
                <img src="/media/wrap.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Gideon Hezekiah on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                </br>There are countless tutorials on how to do headwraps and turbans, and if you say you don’t look good with your hair wrapped, </br> you’re lying. When it’s hot and/or windy out, show your hair some love with hair food/deep conditioner, throw on a turban and </br> go about your day. </br>
                Not only will this protect your hair from the elements, but it will also lock moisture into your hair and in many cases, soften it. </br>
                What’s not to love!
            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4><strong>Do Not</strong> be shy with your Conditioner.</h4> </br>
                <img src="/media/shy.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Kelsey Curtis on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                </br>That bottle of liquid gold is your hair’s best friend. Around once a week, I like to saturate my hair in my favourite deep conditioner </br> and throw on a shower cap under my microfiber towel. I let that sit for an hour and my hair loves it. </br>
                There are also different hair masks you can try out, but this is usually a trial-and-error process. Some naturals swear against coconut </br> oil masks because their hair just doesn’t like coconut oil. On the other hand, a lot of naturals are crazy for coconut oil. </br>
                So, it all boils down to what your hair likes.

        <h3 class="highlight">Some <span>Tips</span></h3></br>
    <ol>
        <li>Before you spend your life’s savings on shampoos, conditioners and leave in conditioners, look at the ingredients. </br> You always want water/aqua to be the very first ingredient. Water is an amazing moisturizer!</li> </br>
        <li>Invest in a satin/silk pillowcase. Your regular pillowcase absorbs your hair’s moisture, which is not what we want. </li> </br>
        <li>Take your vitamins.</li></br>
        <li>Stay hydrated.</li>
