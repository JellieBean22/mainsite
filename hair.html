        <p style="text-align:center;">So, you’re here because your hair won’t grow. Well… </br>
            Your hair is always growing. The problem is that your hair also breaks. </br>
            </br>If your hair is breaking and growing at the same rate, the length will remain the same. </br> If your hair is breaking faster than it’s growing, it will get shorter, and if your hair barely breaks, </br>that’s when you see proper growth. </br>
            </br>This post is not about miracle hair growth treatments and all that magical, mythical madness. </br>This is about ways to retain your hair’s length.</br>

        <h2>Why Won't My Hair <span>Grow?!</span></h2> </br>
        <h3 class="highlight"><span>6 possible</span> reasons you’re not seeing growth</h3></br>
        <br><h4>1. High Manipulation </h4></br>
        <img src="/media/manipulate.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Obi - @pixel6propix on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            High manipulation is when handling, styling and maintaining hair is done regularly. </br> This includes using heat and using a lot of tension… a massive no-no. </p></br>
        <h4>2. Brushing Dry Hair </h4></br>
        <img src="/media/brush-dry.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by shahin khalaji on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            There are only two instances where you can brush your hair thoughtlessly; when your hair is flat-ironed or blown out. </br>
            Other than that, you need to take your sweet, sweet time and pay attention to what you're doing. </br>
            </br>Brushing your hair while it's wet and conditioned is the best method. </br> This ensures that your hair has slip, and that means those little knots are more likely to just slide right out.</br>
            When you brush through your curls while they're dry, you end up pulling out knots and creating unneeded tension. 
        </p></br>
        <h4>3. Cotton Pillowcases</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/cotton.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Paula Campos on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            When you rest your pretty little head on cotton pillows, you’re summoning breakage. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What happens when you sleep is you move around, your hair moves around and the fluffy material on your pillowcase </br> sneakily snags your little hair strands. </br> </br>Did somebody say “hell no”?</br>
            </br>The material also soaks up the good stuff you have in your hair, leading to dry hair, which leads to… drumroll please. </br> Breakage!
        </p></br>
        <h4>4. Dryness</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/dryness.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Natalia Valverde on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            There are a lot of reasons your hair may be dry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Washing your hair too often, using hot water on your hair and neglecting your beautiful mane all contribute to dryness. 
        </p>
        <p>  
            Luckily, there are numerous ways to restore hydration.
        </p></br>
        <h4>5. Too Much Touching</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/touching.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Jeff Hardi on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            This can cause frizziness. If your hair is already weak, touching it too often will definitely lead to breakage. 
        </p></br>
        <h4>6. Not Enough Water</h4></br>
        <img src="/media/water.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Boxed Water Is Better on Unsplash" class="body_img">
        <p>
            Your hair is a growing entity. It needs to be hydrated, just like you need hydration. </br> If you don't drink water, your body will make you wish you did. The same goes for your hair: if you neglect it, it will neglect you.
        </p> </br>

        <h2>Things <span>You </span>Can Do</h2>
        <ul>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Low Manipulation Hairstyles </h4></br>
                <img src="/media/low-man.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by donald modeste on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                    </br>The main aim of a low manipulation hairstyle is to keep your hands away from your hair. </br> 
                        Wearing your hair loose often is a bad idea. This is because not only will you constantly (and most of the time, </br> subliminally) be touching your hair, it will be exposed to wind and it will rub on your clothes… <br/> </br>The horsemen of hair breakage.  </br>
                        </br>Putting your hair into a puff is a great way to avoid over manipulation. In this case, your ends are still exposed but </br>your hair won’t get in your face and you have a much lower chance of ceaselessly touching your hair. </br>
                    </li> </br>
                </br>
                <li>
                <h4> Wet Your Yair </h4></br>
                <img src="/media/wet-it.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Jernej Graj on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <br>For me, it’s 100% mandatory to brush my hair only when it’s wet and has a comfortable amount of product on it.  </br> Even then, I take time to part my hair into sections and finger-detangle each section before going in with a brush. </br>
                This helps you avoid breakage and unnecessary tension on your scalp.  </br> An easy way to do this is to brush your hair in the shower. </br>Alternatively, you could fill a spray bottle with water and just spritz each section of hair as you go. </br>
                One of my favourite things to do is mix conditioner in my spray bottle. It's quite the time-saver!

                <h4>Invest in Satin </h4></br>
                <img src="/media/invest.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Sarah Brown on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <br>Satin. What’s not to love? </br> Sleeping on a satin/silk pillowcase gives your hair the freedom to move around seamlessly. <br>Not only that, it also makes it easier for you to preserve hairstyles, retain moisture and prevent frizz. </br> 
                You can also use satin hair bonnets or wrap a satin scarf around your pillow. </br>
            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Deep Condition </h4></br>
                <img src="/media/shampoo.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Charisse Kenion on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <br/>One of the ways you can rehydrate your hair is to deep condition it.  </br> To intensify the effectiveness of your deep conditioner, while it’s in your hair, put a plastic shower cap <br> on your head, then wrap it all up in a towel. </br>
                Then you can leave your hair like that so it can soak up all the yummy goodness of your deep conditioner.<br>
                If you don’t have a plastic shower cap, you can use a plastic bag. <br>The reason we use a plastic cover is that it traps the heat that radiates from your head, which helps your hair <br>follicles absorb the product even better.

            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Hands Off </h4></br>
                <img src="/media/hands-off.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Alvin Balemesa on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <br>Try styling your hair in ways that require a minimal amount of manipulation. </br> Keep your hair out of your face so you don't have to constantly touch your hair to move it out of your face. </br>
                Tie your hair in a low bun. This will keep the ends of your hair protected, and reduce breakage. </br>
            </li> </br>
        </br>
            <li>
                <h4>Stay Hydrated </h4></br>
                <img src="/media/hydrate.jpg" width="600px";height="400px"; alt="Photo by Boxed Water Is Better on Unsplash" class="body_img">
                <br>I've said it before, and I'll say it again... Your hair needs water, just like you. </br>
                If your hair is dehydrated, it will lose the strength it needs to stay in tact. </br> So be sure to stay hydrated to make sure your hair does too. </br>
            </li>
